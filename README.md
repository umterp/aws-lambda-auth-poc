# API Gateway v2 Lambda Authprozer POC

This is a dummy project for CDK development with TypeScript. The purpose of this package is to test the behavior when scaffolding an API Gateway with a lambda consumer and a lambda authorizer via the CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
